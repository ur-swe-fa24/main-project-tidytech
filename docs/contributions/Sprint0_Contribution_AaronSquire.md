I was in charge of organizing and creating all the initial directories/files necessary for everyone for this sprint. We then all equally translated our notes from our field trip into user stories. I then did the individual contribution of putting about half of the user stories in the product backlog. Finally, we all equally did the staffing document, but I was the one who was in charge of doing the git operations with it.
