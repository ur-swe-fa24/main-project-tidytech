# Use Case Description
The use case diagram shows how the Senior Manager, Building Operator, Building Manager, and Field Engineer interact with a cleaning robot fleet management system. Each user role is associated with specific functionalities in the system to manage and monitor the cleaning robots. The Senior Manager uses the provided business report to review operational and business analytics from the cleaning activities. The Building Operator interacts with the system by using the interface to task the robots and assign tasks/responsibilities to the robots. The Building Manager utilizes two main use cases: restrict certain room access for robots, which allows them to limit robot access to specific areas, and set robot cleaning schedule. The Field Engineer uses two use cases: view robot location, to track where each robot is operating in real time, and to receive notifications/alerts, to be informed of any issues or important updates regarding the robot fleet. Some of these use cases, such as tasking robots, may be shared between the Building Operator and Building Manager roles, indicating that multiple roles can control and monitor robot activities.
